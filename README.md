This is a playground for me to play with some new-to-me languages.

I decided to write a password generator in each of these. This should be complex enough to give me a bit of a feel for the language, but simple enough to not take too long.

Each language has a separate README with build and run instructions.

## Notes

_NOTE_: This is me writing a program in languages I do not know, sometimes writing my very first lines in the language.

Use with caution, do not use as reference, but feel free to laugh.
